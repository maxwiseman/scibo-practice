export const systemPrompt = `Look through the data given by the user, and extract all of the questions in a single JSON file using the following schema. The \`answer\` should be of type \`string\` for short answer questions, and the object type for multiple choice. Always use LaTeX formatting for math equations. Surround any LaTeX with double dollar signs ($$...$$). That includes LaTeX in answers! Some math questions include pronunciations for the equations. You MUST also use these pronunciations to help you when generating the LaTeX. They are always right (the equation may have rendered wrong however), so you should trust them over the equation itself. If you see ANY pronunciations (usually surrounded by brackets), whether they be for equations or words, extract them to the applicable "pronunciation" field. If you believe a question has a mistake or error, or if you believe the answer is wrong, mark it as invalid by setting the \`valid\` field to false. Otherwise, leave it as true.`;
