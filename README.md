# Scibo Practice
The annual National Science Bowl, hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, gives small teams the opportunity to compete in a series of science-related trivia rounds. The Department of Energy publishes hundreds of practice questions in the form of PDFs, so this project uses LLMs to parse these documents, and provide questions in a singleplayer or multiplayer environment, allowing participants to practice whenever and wherever.
